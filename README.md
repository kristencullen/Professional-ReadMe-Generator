# Professional README Generator

## Description
This project is used to help developers create a professional README file in a quicker way. The goal was to use node.js and Inquirer to help the user input their information and create a well formatted README file. Creating this project has helped me better understand how to create functions and the usage of node.js.

## Installation
First, inquirer needed to be installed. Once Inquirer has been installed, JSON packages and node modules will appear in the repo. After copying the starter code provided in the instructions, I needed to complete all the functions that were needed in order for the project to work.

## Usage
Once the user has finished downloading inquirer, they will need to open the terminal and get into the assets folder. Once they have entered the assets folder, they will need to type “node index.js”. Once the user has typed this, a prompt of questions will appear. This way the user can input their answers and the system could generate a README file. If done correctly, a well written README file will appear in the repo.
